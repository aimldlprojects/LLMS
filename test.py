To replicate the same environment you described, where the Docker CLI is using **Podman** in RHEL 9, you would follow these steps to install and configure **Podman** and alias it to Docker.

### Steps to Set Up Docker CLI with Podman in RHEL 9:

1. **Update the system**:
   Start by ensuring your RHEL 9 system is updated.
   ```bash
   sudo dnf update -y
   ```

2. **Install Podman**:
   RHEL 9 comes with **Podman** available in the default repositories, so install it using `dnf`.
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y podman
   ```

3. **Verify Podman installation**:
   After installation, verify that Podman is installed by checking its version.
   ```bash
   podman --version
   ```

4. **Configure Docker CLI to use Podman**:
   In RHEL 9, the Docker CLI is often aliased to Podman by default. You can confirm this by running the following command:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```
   If it shows something like "Docker CLI using Podman" or returns the Podman version, you are all set. Otherwise, you can create the alias manually.

5. **Create a Docker alias (if needed)**:
   If Docker is not already aliased to Podman, you can create the alias manually by adding this to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`):
   ```bash
   echo 'alias docker=podman' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

6. **Configure rootless Podman (optional)**:
   If you want to run containers without root privileges (rootless containers), configure Podman to support it:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y fuse-overlayfs
   ```

7. **Start Podman**:
   Podman does not require a daemon, so you don't need to start it like Docker. However, you can verify it’s working by running:
   ```bash
   podman info
   ```

8. **Run Docker/Podman commands**:
   You can now use the **Docker CLI** commands (`docker run`, `docker build`, etc.) and they will work with **Podman** as the container engine.

### Additional Optional Steps:

- **Install `podman-compose`**: If you need Docker Compose functionality, you can use `podman-compose`, which is an alternative to `docker-compose`.
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install -y podman-compose
  ```

- **Set up container networking**: If your application requires advanced networking (like Docker's bridge networking), Podman supports it but may require additional setup.

### Summary:
By installing **Podman** and configuring the Docker alias to use Podman, you'll replicate the environment where the Docker CLI works with Podman in RHEL 9.



The error you're seeing indicates that the `podman-compose` package is not available in your current RHEL 9 repositories. To resolve this, you can try the following steps:

### 1. **Register with Red Hat Subscription Manager (If Applicable)**:
   If you have access to Red Hat subscriptions, you will need to register your system:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install epel-release
   sudo subscription-manager register
   sudo subscription-manager attach --auto
   ```

   Then, enable the necessary repositories:
   ```bash
   sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
   sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms
   ```

   After this, update your repositories and try installing `podman-compose` again:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf update
   sudo dnf install -y podman-compose
   ```

### 2. **Install `podman-compose` Using Python's `pip` (If Not Using Subscription)**:
   If you do not have a Red Hat subscription or prefer an alternative approach, you can install `podman-compose` via Python’s package manager `pip`.

   First, install `pip` if it’s not already available:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y python3-pip
   ```

   Then install `podman-compose` using `pip`:
   ```bash
   sudo pip3 install podman-compose
   ```

### 3. **Verify Installation**:
   After installation, check if `podman-compose` is installed successfully by running:
   ```bash
   podman-compose --version
   ```

### 4. **Run Podman and Podman-Compose Commands**:
   You can now use `podman-compose` to manage containerized applications similarly to `docker-compose`.

By following these steps, you should be able to get `podman-compose` installed and working even without access to Red Hat's repositories.




To use Docker Compose on RHEL 9, you'll need to install Docker first, since Podman is a separate tool. Here’s how to install Docker and Docker Compose on RHEL 9:

### Step 1: Install Docker

1. **Remove any old versions of Docker:**
   ```bash
   sudo dnf remove docker docker-common docker-snapshot docker-engine
   ```

2. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
   ```

3. **Set up the Docker repository:**
   ```bash
   sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo=https://download.docker.com/linux/rhel/docker-ce.repo
   ```

4. **Install Docker:**
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
   ```

5. **Start and enable the Docker service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```

6. **Verify that Docker is installed correctly:**
   ```bash
   sudo docker run hello-world
   ```

### Step 2: Install Docker Compose

1. **Download the latest version of Docker Compose:**
   Replace `v2.16.0` with the latest version available on the [Docker Compose releases page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases).
   ```bash
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.16.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

2. **Make the binary executable:**
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

3. **Verify the installation:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose --version
   ```

### Notes:
- Ensure you have `sudo` access and an internet connection to download the necessary packages.
- If you're still facing issues with registering or using `subscription-manager`, you may want to consult with your system administrator or RHEL support to get the appropriate access. 

After completing these steps, you should be able to use Docker and Docker Compose as intended.



To install `docker-compose` on a RHEL 9 system, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Docker (if not already installed)

Make sure you have Docker installed. If you haven't installed it yet, use the following commands:

```bash
# Update the package index
sudo dnf update -y

# Install required packages
sudo dnf install -y yum-utils

# Set up the Docker repository
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/rhel/docker-ce.repo

# Install Docker
sudo dnf install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

# Start Docker service
sudo systemctl start docker

# Enable Docker to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

### Step 2: Install Docker Compose

1. **Download the Docker Compose binary:**

   You can download the latest stable release of Docker Compose with the following command. Make sure to check for the latest version on the [Docker Compose releases page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) and replace `1.29.2` with the latest version if needed:

   ```bash
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

2. **Set the permissions:**

   Make the binary executable:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

3. **Verify the installation:**

   Check if Docker Compose is installed correctly by checking its version:

   ```bash
   docker-compose --version
   ```

### Step 3: (Optional) Enable Docker to run without sudo

If you want to run Docker commands without needing `sudo`, you can add your user to the `docker` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

After adding the user to the group, log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

### Conclusion

You should now have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your RHEL 9 system. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask!




To install Docker Compose on your server, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Docker Compose binary**:
   You can download the specific version you want (e.g., v2.15.1) with the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.15.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

2. **Make the binary executable**:
   After downloading, you need to set the executable permissions:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

3. **Verify the installation**:
   You can verify that Docker Compose has been installed correctly by checking its version:

   ```bash
   docker-compose --version
   ```

This will install Docker Compose on your server, allowing you to use it with Podman as the backend if desired. If you encounter any issues, please let me know!
