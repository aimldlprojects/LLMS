Dear Vox Support Team,

I'm writing to request assistance with integrating Langchain and the Vox API for our project, specifically to utilize SQL query chains and SQL agents.

Our Objectives:

Employ SQL agents for more comprehensive task completion involving both language understanding and database interactions.

Challenges Encountered:
We're facing issues using custom LLMs with langchain.

Request:

Technical Support: We'd appreciate guidance on:
Configuring Langchain with Vox API.
Implementing SQL query chains and agents effectively.
Resolving issues with custom LLMs within the Vox environment.

Thank you for your time and support.
